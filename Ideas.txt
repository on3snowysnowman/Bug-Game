Commander Perks
Bug attack types: [Burrowing, Air, Ranged, Tank, Swarm]

Burrowing can potentially bypass sectors, skipping heavily defended sections 
    that don't defend well against burrowing bugs.


 -- Power and Resources -- 

Resources:

    Power - Energizes most buildings and defenses.
    Oil - Used for power generation and incendiary weapon fuel.
    Ore - Base material, smelted into metal.
    Crystal - Used for advanced materials and high tech buildings.
    Metal - Refined ore, used for many basic/standard buildings.
    Alloy - Refined from Metal + Crystal, for advanced buildings.
    

 Power expands through simple "Power Grid" blocks that have a one time purchase
 and must be connected to other grid blocks. 


 -- Mechanics -- 

Have special sector bonuses be lost (rich veins, oil pockets) if a sector 
    becomes infested.

 What do they need to keep track of?

    - Resources
    - Power Stored
    - Buildings
    - Sector Traits
    - Defense level

Possible Traits:

    - Ore Veins: Ore is common here and can be excavated.

    - Oil Deposits: Deep oil pools allow for simple extraction.

    - Crystal Formations: Naturally occurring crystals can be harvested in this 
        sector.

    - Rich Ore Veins: Particularly rich ore veins provide a much higher yield.

    - Heavy Oil Pockets: Larger oil reserves allow for increased extraction 
        efficiency.

    - Radiant Crystal Deposit: Pure, radiant crystals in this sector 
        provide a significantly higher output during harvesting.

    - Rough Terrain: Difficult terrain hinders bug attacks but 
        also limits building opportunities.

    - Bug Nest: This sector contains an entrenched bug hive, rendering 
        construction impossible.

     - Heavy Fog: Dense fog reduces visibility, hindering detection of incoming
        attacks.
